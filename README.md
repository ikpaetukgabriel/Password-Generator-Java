# Password-Generator-Java
Generates at least A uppercase letters, at least B lowercase letters, at least C digits and consists of exactly N symbols. Also, the password cannot contain two or more of the same characters in a row.
For the given numbers A, B, C, and N, it outputs a password that matches these requirements.
It is guaranteed that A, B, C, and N are non-negative integers, and A + B + C <= N. Keep in mind that any parameter can be equal to zero. It means that it's ok if the password doesn't contain symbols of such type.
